1. Introduction
This project is designed to make ride allocation more efficient and equitable in a ride-hailing app by applying a Driver Acceptance Score system. The score system will assess drivers with respect to their ride acceptance behavior and reward them with incentives, priority, and performance-based benefits. A Dynamic Demand Management System will also be created that will predict demand for rides, position drivers optimally, and add pre-scheduling features for users.

2. Driver Acceptance Score System
Each driver will have an Acceptance Score derived from several performance measures, such as:

Traffic Conditions: Past ride acceptance in different traffic conditions.

Trip Difficulty: Rates of acceptance for long-distance, low-fare, or challenging terrain rides.

Fare Acceptance Patterns: Regularity of accepting fair fare offers.

Rejection Behavior: Rate and causes of trip rejections.

3. Applications of Acceptance Score

Ride Prioritization: Higher acceptance score drivers will be given preference for canceled rides to complete the ride faster.

Performance-Based Rewards: Top-ranked drivers will be rewarded with fuel discounts, special offers, and ranking rewards.

Targeted Incentives: The lower-scoring drivers will also be given higher incentives for picking up peak-hour or challenging rides until their score has reached an established threshold.

Penalty System: These cancellations, including the cause for cancellation, will be monitored and appropriate penalties enforced to uphold reliability of the service.

Score Update Mechanism: The acceptance score will be updated every two months with a decay factor to make sure recent performance plays a larger role than older ride history.

4. Dynamic Demand Management System
A heatmap-based demand forecast will be incorporated to offer real-time and short-term ride demand predictions within a certain radius (e.g., 1 km). This functionality will enable:

Motivations to relocate to high-demand locations with lower supply.

Riders to pre-book rides during peak hours, lowering wait times and maximizing fleet allocation.

Dynamic Pricing Options: Riders can either wait for a lower fare or pay an extra fee for priority booking.

One-Assured Ride Feature: High-acceptance drivers will be prioritized for essential rides, ensuring ride availability.

5. Conclusion
This project aims to enhance ride-hailing efficiency by promoting driver accountability and improving demand-supply balance through data-driven insights. The integration of an acceptance score system and demand forecasting will result in optimized ride distribution, improved driver earnings, and a better experience for riders.
